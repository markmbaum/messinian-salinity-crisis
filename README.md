This repository contains code for simulating Mediterranean Sea level during the first stage of the Messinian Salinity Crisis, using an adapted version of the model of
* [Garcia-Castellanos and Villasenor, *Messinian salinity crisis regulated by competing tectonics and erosion at the Gibraltar arc.* Nature 480.7377 (2011).](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature10651)

The model is implemented in C++ and Python. Have a look at the [**documentation**](https://markmbaum.github.io/messinian-salinity-crisis/).
