# Messinian Salinity Crisis [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.5150871.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5150871)

This repository contains code for simulating Mediterranean Sea level during the first stage of the [Messinian Salinity Crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messinian_salinity_crisis), as detailed in
* [Baum, M. M. *Critical Analysis of Mediterranean Sea Level Limit Cycles During the Messinian Salinity Crisis*. Geologica Acta 11 (2021).

The model is implemented in C++ and Python, with [**documentation available here**](https://markmbaum.github.io/messinian-salinity-crisis/). It is an adapted version of the model first described in
* [Garcia-Castellanos and Villasenor, *Messinian salinity crisis regulated by competing tectonics and erosion at the Gibraltar arc.* Nature 480.7377 (2011).](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature10651)
