This code is a simplified, consolidated, C++ implementation of a prior Messinian Salinity Crisis model\+:

\end{DoxyItemize}

The equations and variables of the model are implemented in the {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{msc__gcv_8h}{msc\+\_\+gcv.\+h}}} and {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{msc__gcv_8cc}{msc\+\_\+gcv.\+cc}}} files as a class called \mbox{\hyperlink{class_msc_gcv}{Msc\+Gcv}}. The {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{linalg_8cc}{linalg.\+cc}}} and {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{newton_8cc}{newton.\+cc}}} files contain standard numerical algorithms used by the model. The {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{util_8cc}{util.\+cc}}} file has some miscellaneous useful functions. Finally, the {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{main__single_8cc}{main\+\_\+single.\+cc}}} and {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{main__sweep_8cc}{main\+\_\+sweep.\+cc}}} files are two separate driver files. They are compiled by the Makefile into {\ttfamily bin/single.\+exe} and {\ttfamily bin/sweep.\+exe}. The {\ttfamily single.\+exe} program runs a single integration of the model, writes output into the {\ttfamily out} directory, and attempts to find and display the model\textquotesingle{}s fixed point. The results of {\ttfamily single.\+exe} can be plotted with {\ttfamily scripts/plot\+\_\+out.\+py}. The {\ttfamily sweep.\+exe} file runs, in parallel, a grid of many integrations over ranges of key parameters, testing whether the model oscillates. The model runs on top of O\+DE integrators from \href{https://github.com/wordsworthgroup/libode}{\texttt{ libode}}.

Basic steps to compile the code\+:
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item download and compile \href{https://github.com/wordsworthgroup/libode}{\texttt{ libode}}
\item copy/rename the {\ttfamily \+\_\+config.\+mk} file {\ttfamily config.\+mk}, getting rid of the leading underscore
\item edit {\ttfamily config.\+mk} to have the proper compiler configuration and path to {\ttfamily libode}
\item run {\ttfamily make} at the command line
\item {\ttfamily single.\+exe} and {\ttfamily sweep.\+exe} should be present in the {\ttfamily bin} directory
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

To run {\ttfamily single.\+exe} and plot the results\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{./bin/single.exe}
\DoxyCodeLine{cd scripts}
\DoxyCodeLine{python plot\_out.py}
\DoxyCodeLine{cd ..}
\end{DoxyCode}


To run {\ttfamily sweep.\+exe}\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{./bin/sweep.exe N out}
\DoxyCodeLine{cd scripts}
\DoxyCodeLine{python slice\_sweep\_combos.py}
\DoxyCodeLine{cd ..}
\end{DoxyCode}
 replacing N with the number of values to use for each varied parameter.
